<p class="text">
    <span class="bold">JavaScript is a High Level, Lightweight, Single threated, interpreted
        or Just in time compiled, dynamic language with first class functions.</span>
</p>

<p class="text">JavaScript is most <span class="bold">Popular</span> ðŸ˜¯ programming language in the world ðŸŒŽ! But one of
    the popular
    misconception ðŸ¤” about JavaScript is, people think that "Java" and "JavaScript" are same.
</p>

<p class="text">
    No! Java and JavaScript are not same thing. They both are completely different programming languages!
</p>

<p class="text">JavaScript is everywhere! It is in Browsers, Servers, Mobile Apps, Desktop Apps,
    Smart Watches etc. JS is used as frontend in browsers as well as in backend in servers
    with the help of Node.js.
</p>

<h2>History of Javascript</h2>
<p class="text">
    JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 just in 10 days. Became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.
    It was originally named Mocha and later known as JavaScript.
    It was developed for Netscape. Now Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser.
</p>
<h2>Javascript Engine</h2>
<p class="text">
    It is a software that executes JavaScript code. JavaScript engine is a part of modern browsers,
    when javascript was invented, it was a interpreted language. But now modern browsers use just in time (JIT)
    compilation to improve performance. JavaScript engine is used not only in browsers but also it is a core
    component of Node.js. Example of some famous JavaScript engines are -
</p>
<ul>
    <li>V8 engine by Google for Google Chrome</li>
    <li>Spider monkey by Mozilla for Firefox Browser</li>
    <li>JavaScriptCore by Apple for Safari Browser</li>
    <li>Chakra by Microsoft for Internet Explorer</li>
    <li>Chakra was used by Microsoft Edge browser, but now it uses V8 engine</li>
</ul>

<h2>What happens in JavaScript engine?</h2>
<p class="text">
    JavaScript engine converts high level code into machine readable code. Different JavaScript engines use different
    techniques to execute JavaScript code. Some engines use interpreter and compiler both (e.g. V8 engine). As an
    example, Google chrome's JavaScript V8 engine works like this -
</p>
<div data-image="js engine.jpg"></div> 
<p class="text">
    First JavaScript source code goes to Parser. Manly it checks for syntax. Breaks the codes into token.
    <br><br>
    Now these tokens are converted to to AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) it allows
    interpreter to read the code and understand.
    <br><br>
    Now AST goes to Interpreter to get converted into Byte code.
    In V8 engine it is known as <span class="bold">Ignition</span>
    <br><br>
    If there is repeating code, it will decrease the performance of interpreter.
    <span class="bold">Profiler</span> will check repeating codes.
    To increase performance <span class="bold">Profiler</span>
    moves repeating code to compiler.
    <br><br>
    Compiler generates byte code. Byte code executes to do specific task.
    In v8 engine this compiler is called as TurboFan. <span class="bold">TurboFan</span>.
</p>

<h2>What can we do with Javascript?</h2>
<p class="text">
    JavaScript is a cross platform language. We can use it to build dynamic webpages that will work
    on multiple platform. We can use Javascript in backend too, using Node.js as a server. We will learn 
    about it in the next chapter.
</p>


<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p class="text">
    Open developer options in a modern browser. 
    (<span class="incode">F12</span> or 
    <span class="incode">ctrl</span> + 
    <span class="incode">shift</span>+
    <span class="incode">I</span>). 
    Or setup your favorite code editor for writing JavaScript code.
</p>

<h2>Hello World</h2>
<p class="text">
    If you are learning a new programming language, you have to write "Hello World". 
    "It's the law"ðŸ˜…. Let's Write "Hello World"
</p>
-->
<!-- <div data-image="meme/Hello World.jpg" data-image-alt="Write Hello World"></div> -->

<!--

<div class="js code" data-code="intro/Hello World.js"></div>
<div class="console">Hello World</div>
<p class="text">
    Output will be visible in <span class="bold">console</span>.
</p>

<p class="text">
    JavaScript is case sensitive. Means <span class="incode">hello</span>
    and <span class="incode">Hello</span> are not same.
</p>

<div class="js code" data-code="intro/case sensitive.js"></div>
<div class="console">Hello, How are you?<br>Hii</div>

<p class="text">
    Don't worry if you don't understand <span class="incode">let</span> ,
    <span class="incode">console</span> , <span class="incode">log</span>.
    We will read about them in next chapter. For now, just notice 
    <span class="incode">hello</span> and <span class="incode">Hello</span>
    are not same.
</p>

<h2>Statement</h2>
<p class="text">
    A statement is a line of code commanding a task.
    JavaScript statements ends with <span class="intext">;</span>
    But it is optional (it is recommended by many developers).
</p>

<p class="text">
    If we have to write more
    than one statement in one line, we have to use semicolon to separate each statement.
</p>
<div class="js code" data-code="intro/statement.js"></div>  
<div class="js code" data-code="intro/semicolon.js"></div>
<p class="text">
    JavaScript ignores multiple whitespace between statements. Using one whitespace makes the code
    more readable. To break a long statement, best practice to break it after a operator.
</p>
<div class="js code" data-code="intro/whitespace.js"></div>


<p class="text">
    There are four types of
    statements in JavaScript - Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
</p>


<h2>Block</h2>
<p class="text">
    To bind multiple JavaScript statements  , we have to use
    <span class="incode">{ }</span> curly brackets. Code inside those curly brackets are called
    <span class="bold">Block</span> or <span class="bold">Block code</span>.
</p>


<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p class="text">
    <span class="bold">Syntax</span> is a set of rules to construct a program.
    JavaScript Syntax is similar to C, C++. 
</p>

<h2>Keywords</h2>
<p>
