<p class="text">
    <span class="bold">JavaScript is a  High Level, Lightweight, Single threated, interpreted 
    or Just in time compiled, dynamic language with first class functions.</span>
</p>

<p class="text">JavaScript is most <span class="bold">Popular</span> ðŸ˜¯ programming language in the world ðŸŒŽ! But one of the popular
    misconception ðŸ¤” about JavaScript is, people think that "Java" and "JavaScript" are same.
</p>

<!-- <div class="" data-image="meme/Java is not js.jpg"></div> -->

<p class="text">No! Java and JavaScript are not same thing. They both are completely different programming languages!</p>

<p class="text">JavaScript is everywhere! It is in Browsers, Servers, Mobile Apps, Desktop Apps,
     Smart Watches etc. JS is used as frontend in browsers as well as in backend in servers
     with the help of Node.js.

<h2>History of Javascript</h2>
<p class="text">
    JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 just in  10 days. Became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.
    It was originally named Mocha and later known as JavaScript.
    It was developed for Netscape. Now Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser.
</p>

<h2>Javascript Engine</h2>
<p class="text">
    It is a software or program that executes JavaScript code. JavaScript engine is a part of modern browsers,
    when javascript was invented, it was a interpreted language. But now modern browsers use just in time (JIT)
    compilation to improve performance. JavaScript engine is used not only in browsers but also it is a core
    component of Node.js. Example of some famous JavaScript engines are -
</p>
<ul>
    <li>V8 engine by Google used in Google Chrome</li>
    <li>Spider monkey by Mozilla used in Firefox Browser</li>
    <li>JavaScriptCore by apple used in Safari Browser</li>
    <li>Chakra by Microsoft used in Internet Explorer</li>
    <li>Chakra was used by Microsoft Edge browser, but now it uses V8 engine</li>
</ul>

<h2>What happens in JavaScript engine?</h2>
<p class="text">
    JavaScript engines convert high level code into machine readable code to execute the code.
    Different JavaScript uses different techniques to execute JavaScript code. Some engines
    use interpreter and compiler both (e.g. V8 engine).
    As an example, Google chrome's JavaScript V8 engine works like this -
</p>
<p class="text">
    First JavaScript source code goes to Parser manly it checks for syntax.
    Breaks the codes into token.
    <br><br>
    Now these tokens are converted to to AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) it allows
    interpreter to read the code and understand.
    <br><br>
    Now AST goes to Interpreter to get converted to Byte code. In V8 engine it
    is known as <span class="bold">Ignition</span>
    <br><br>
    If there is repeating code, it will decrease the performance of interpreter.
    <span class="bold">Profiler</span> will check repeating codes.
    To increase performance <span class="bold">Profiler</span>
    moves repeating code to compiler.
    <br><br>
    It generates byte code. And Byte codes execute and do specific task.
    In v8 engine this compiler is called as <span class="bold">TurboFan</span>.
